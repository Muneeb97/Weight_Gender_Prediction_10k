# Weight_Gender_Prediction_10k
Weight prediction using a dataset with gender, weight and height and then something interesting

First, we simply explore the data with a few basic statistics and visualizations to get to know how the data is distributed.

Afterwards, we train multiple linear models from Sklearn Library to predict Weight based on Height, first for each gender seperately than collectively for the whole dataset.

After completing this, we train a logistic regression model from the same module to predict gender based on the given values of height and weight.

The dataset contains 10K rows and Gender, Height,	Weight(lbs), Weight(kgs) as columns.
